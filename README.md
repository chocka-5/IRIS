# IRIS

Visually challenged people constantly need someone's aid to do their day to day activities. But in today's
hectic world it is not possible for someone to constantly take care of them. Moreover they yearn for an
opportunity to break free from the shackles of their disability and lead an independent life. This was our
motivation behind designing an all-inclusive visual aid kit for giving them an opportunity to cope with their
impairment. Although there are lots of technologies available today, they are far from accessible for
those without sight. Our main aim is to help the blind enjoy their fair share of these technologies.
The kit consists of an eye wear equipped with a camera and a headphone. This device assists them in
both the real and the virtual world. This device will help them read books and sign-boards using OCR
(Optical Character Recognition) which is a crucial need in their day to day life. This can also help
recognize objects like an apple or a key and augment their disability. Also this device can detect faces
familiar to them. These tasks will be achieved using CV (Computer Vision).

#Additional features of the kit are:
1 Accessing information from sites like Wikipedia.
2 Playing songs that they choose to listen to.
3 Reading out E-mails to them.
4 Providing details of the weather, date and time.

The best part of this project is that it responds to voice commands and is very easy to use. It can be
powered using a portable power bank. This can also function as a talk buddy since it responds to
questions intelligently and not only follows commands .
